# New in Leo 4.3:
# 1. createLeoDist.py is distributed in dist directory.
#   - The distribution script temporarily copies createLeoDist.py to the leo directory.
# 2. Distribute leoDist.leo, not leoDistRef.leo.
# 3. .pycheckrc is created and distributed in dist directory.
#   (The user should move it to the home directory if he/she wants to use it.)
