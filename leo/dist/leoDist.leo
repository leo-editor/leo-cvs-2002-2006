<t tx="EKR.20040519090846.3">System requirements for leo.py
------------------------------

leo.py requires Python 2.2.1 or above and tcl/tk 8.4 or above.

	Download Python from http://python.org/ 
	Download tcl/Tk from http://tcl.activestate.com/software/tcltk/

Warning: When building Tcl on Linux, do not specify "--enable-threads" .
Only use Tcl with the default "threads not enabled" case.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040519090846.4">
Installing the leo.py on Linux
------------------------------

You can install Leo using the install script provided.  Remember to 'chmod +x' before running this script.

Leo is distributed as a single compressed (.zip) folder.  Simply uncompress this folder, put the folder in a convenient place and run leo.py.  You can run leo.py by double-clicking leo.py.  You can also run leo.py from a Python interpreter as follows:

	import leo
	leo.run() # runs leo.py, opening a new outline.
	leo.go() # runs leo.py after reloading all modules.
	leo.leoOpen(fileName) # runs leo.py, reloads all modules, and opens fileName.

You may specify options using the configuration file called leoSettings.leo.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040519090846.5">
Installing the leo.py on Windows
--------------------------------

Important: You can install leo.py on Windows using the single-click installer called leosetup.exe.

Leo is distributed as a single compressed (.zip) folder.  Uncompress this folder, put the folder in a convenient place and run leo.py.  You can run leo.py by double-clicking leo.py.  You can also run leo.py from a Python interpreter as follows:

	import leo
	leo.run() # runs leo.py, opening a new outline.

You may specify options using the configuration file called leoSettings.leo.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040519090846.6">
Installing leo.py on MacOs
--------------------------

Leo works reliably only on MacOS X 10.3 (Panther).

To run Leo on Macintosh OS X 10.3:

1) Download and install "MacPython 2.3 for Panther addons".

Python is already included in OS X 10.3 so only the addons are necessary

	http://www.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython.html

2) Download and install TclTkAqua.

	http://tcltkaqua.sourceforge.net/

3) Run the PackageManager found in /Applications/MacPython-2.3 and  
install "_tkinter-2.3-binary" by clicking on the package in the list  
and clicking the [Install:] button with "Install dependencies" checked

4)  Install Leo.  There are two ways to do this.

a)  The NEW way: Download Leo-version-number.pkg from

    http://leo.sourceforge.net/

Double-click Leo.pkg to install the Leo folder. I recommend that you install Leo
in your home directory.

b) The OLD way: Download Leo-version-number.zip:

	http://leo.sourceforge.net/

Unzip the contents into the desired directory by double-clicking the downloaded file.

5) Run Leo by ontrol-clicking on /path_to_unzipped_dir/leo/src/leo.py and open
with PythonLauncher.

6) It is a good idea to set PythonLauncher as the default program to  
open python scripts by clicking on "leo.py", choosing Get Info from the  
Finder's File menu, and selecting "PythonLauncher" as the default  
program to "Open With:"

By clicking the "Change All..." button, all python scripts will be  
opened with PythonLauncher.

8) (optional) Download and install Pmw. (Leo now contains Pmw in the extensions folder).

    http://pmw.sourceforge.net/

Pmw must be installed in order to use the Settings panel.

Drag the downloaded gzip file into
 
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/lib/python2.3/site-packages

Double click on it to unzip and untar the file into a folder to make it
available to Python

Thanks to Randall Voth for these instructions.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040519090846.7">
Using shell scripts and batch files to make using Leo easier
------------------------------------------------------------

On Linux, the following shell script will allow you to open foo.leo files by typing leo foo

#!/bin/sh 
python &lt;leopath&gt;/leo.py $1

where &lt;leopath&gt; is replaced with the path to the leo directory. 

On Windows, the equivalent batch file would be:

c:\python22\python &lt;leopath&gt;leo.py %1

<t tx="EKR.20040519090846.9">Leo 4.3 beta 1                 April 30, 2005

Leo 4.3 beta 1 completes all major features of Leo 4.3. There are no known
significant bugs remaining.

The defining features of Leo 4.3:
---------------------------------
1. Leo now stores options in @settings trees, that is, outlines whose headline
is '@settings'. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees not only
in the outline being opened but also in various leoSettings.leo files.

The key design goal of @settings trees was that Leo's user options must be
infinitely flexible. That goal has been accomplished. Indeed, users can create
arbitrarily complex user options with @settings trees. Leo settings outlines
are, in fact, infinitely more flexible and powerful than any scheme based on
flat text.  Readers of Python's configParser shootout take note!

2. The Settings command temporarily replaces the outline pane with an outline
showing all the @settings trees in effect. The Settings command also replaces
the body pane with a "settings pane". This settings pane allows you to change
the settings selected in the outline pane using standard gui widgets. The
settings pane is dynamically created from nodes in the settings tree; it is as
extensible as the @settings tree itself.

3. Leo now stores recent files information in .leoRecentFiles.txt files.

4. Leo's read/write code in leoAtFile.py has been rewritten to support user-
defined tangling and untangling.  This is a major cleanup of Leo's core.

5. Leo now boasts a wonderful new Plugins Manager plugin. This plugin enables
and disables plugins automatically. You never have to mess with
pluginsManager.txt again! This plugin also tells you everything you need to know
about each plugin. Finally, this plugin also lets you download plugins from
Leo's cvs site! Many thanks to Paul Patterson for this excellent work.

6. You can install third-party extensions in Leo's extensions directory. Leo
will attempt to import such extensions from the extensions directory if normal
imports fail. Leo is distributed with Pmw (Python Mega Widgets), path.py and
sets.py in this directory.</t>

<t tx="EKR.20040519091259.6">Leo 4.1 final is now available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/

Leo 4.1 final is the culmination of four months of work. No
significant bugs have been reported since 4.1 rc4. Several people have
contributed nifty plugins recently. See leoPlugins.leo for full
details.

The highlights version 4.1:
---------------------------
- Leo runs in batch mode when invoked with --script aScriptFile.py
- Leo supports Unicode characters (e.g. Chinese) in path and file names.
- @directives and section references are now valid when executing scripts.
- @ignored and orphan nodes now valid in @file-nosent trees.
- Script-based find/change commands.
- Check Outline command.
- Hoist &amp; DeHoist commands.
- A new gui-agnostic architecture: useful for batch mode and unit tests.
- Several new configuration settings.
- Many new unit tests.
- A host of bug fixes.

Quotes of the month
-------------------

"I'm a newbie to Leo(a couple of weeks) and I feel addicted to
programming again...in fact it has resurrected a dead project of mine :)
The outline has proven most liberating in terms of testing ideas out.
Thanks a lot!" -- anon

"Wow, wow, and wow. I just started using Leo about a month ago..Now I
finally understand how to use clones and I realized that this is
exactly how I want to organize my information.  Multiple views on my
data, fully interlinkable just like my thoughts...Thanks for a great
tool! -- anon

"I *LIKE* it; I was amazed at how [different the Leo] experience was
compared to flat-filing. It was almost Forth-like in the way that it
was possible to work top-down or bottom-up at will (I believe this is
the key to its strength, btw)." --Tarvin Rhodes

<t tx="EKR.20040519091259.8">Leo 4.2 alpha 1            April 14, 2004

This is a "semi-public" release of the new 4.2 code base.  I am releasing this code now to create a snapshot.  In particular, I shall use this snapshot to begin development work on the Macintosh.  This will allow me fix long-standing *nix bugs.

This main feature of this release is that Leo represents clones as nodes that
share trees of vnodes. To make this work Leo introduces _positions_. A position
is a location in the traversal of an outline.

This code appears stable.  I have been using the 4.2 code base for several weeks for all my work with no significant problems.  Nevertheless, this is alpha (or even pre-alpha) quality code.  Use at your own risk.  Make frequent backups.

See the "4.2 Projects" node in LeoPy.leo for details of what has been done so far.  I shall be updating documentation more fully for the first beta release.</t>

<t tx="EKR.20040519091259.10">Leo 4.0 final                     October 17, 2003

More than a year in the making, Leo 4.0 is finally here.

Highlights of 4.0 final:
-----------------------

** Improved and simplified format of derived files.
	- Eliminated child indices, extraneous blank lines and @body sentinels.
	- Eliminated @node sentinels that indicate outline structure.
	- New @nl and @nonl sentinels indicate where newlines are and aren't.
	- These changes will largely eliminate unwanted cvs conflicts.

** Greatly improved error handling.
	- Reading derived files _never_ alter outline structure or links.
	- Read errors leave the outline completely unchanged.
	- Broken clone links are gone forever.
	- As a result, 4.0 is much safer than all previous versions.

** Full compatibility will previous versions of Leo.
	- Leo 4.0 reads all derived files properly, regardless of version.
	- Leo writes new-format derived files by default, and this default may be changed.
	- New commands in the read/write menu allow you to explicitly specify the format of derived files.

* New commands:
	- Write 3.x Derived File and Write 4.x Derived File.
	- Import Derived File.
	- Clear Recent Files.

* Dozens of other improvements, including:
	- Better Unicode support.
	- New configuration settings.
	- Several new plugins.

<t tx="EKR.20040519091259.15">Leo 3.9                               Nov 23, 2002

This is one of the most interesting versions of Leo ever released:

* Major performance improvements:
  - Incremental syntax coloring speeds response when typing.
  - Incremental undo drastically reduces memory used.

* Major improvements in customizing Leo:
  - Leo looks in the file customizeLeo.py for user-specific customizations.

	to locations in the outline.
  - Double-clicking the icon of a @url node launches any url in your web browser.
  - The Execute Script command executes Python code in any body pane.
	This is much more convenient than opening Leo's Idle window.
  - Much better support for cweb. At last, Leo has a power user of cweb.
	By default, @space, @* and @** sections are colored as latex text.
	Leo properly generates @q..@&gt; sentinels.
  - @nosentinelfile is like @file except Leo writes no sentinel lines.

* Other improvements:
  - Optional Emacs-style auto-indent.
  - Reformat Paragraph command.
  - Leo will optionally create nonexistent directories specified in
	@file, @root or @path, including all nonexistent parent directories.
  - Leo will place its own icon in Leo windows provided that you have
	installed Fredrik Lundh's PIL and tkIcon packages.
  - The usual assortment of bug fixes.

Many major improvements have been made to Leo, all made as the result of user requests:

- New @rawfile and @silentfile trees complement @file trees.
  @rawfile and @silentfile trees create derived files without using sections.
  @rawfile files contain only those sentinels needed to automatically untangle them.
  @silentfile trees contain no sentinels at all.
- New @raw and @end_raw directives allow unformatted code within @file trees.
- Much better support for CWEB.  You may organize .w files using noweb!

This version fixes a blunder that affects only  Leo 3.0.
I recommend that all users of 3.0 upgrade to 3.1.

With this release Leo's to-do list is now empty!
I shall fix bugs as they are reported.
I'll add new features only if convinced that they contribute significantly to Leo.

The highlights:

- Fixed a blunder: Leo 3.0 did nothing when it was opened directly from  Leo.
  (Opening leo using openLeo.py did work.)
- Created a compare panel to control scripts in leoCompare.py.
- Added many new settings in leoConfig.txt to initialize the compare panel.
- The FAQ tells how to add support for new languages.
- The usual minor improvements and bug fixes.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040519091259.24">Leo 3.0                                     July 16, 2002

This version is called 3.0 because it can optionally produce files that
can _not_ be read by the  Leo 2.x or the Borland version of Leo.
By default,  Leo 3.0 _does_ produce files that all previous versions of Leo can read.

As always, see LeoDocs.leo for full details.  The highlights:

- Many new user options in leoConfig.txt, including, among others,
  fonts in all panes, colors for syntax coloring and default window size and position.
- Support for .leo files with XML types like "ISO-8859-1", controlled by a user option.
  Note: by default, Leo writes files compatible with previous versions of Leo.
- Powerful new Color and Font pickers, fully connected to user options.
- Added Toggle Split Direction command, under control of user options.
- Added autoscrolling in the outline pane.
- Windows open at the position in which they were saved.

This version corrects crashers that affect undo/redo move commands.
Version 2.5 has been withdrawn.

ANYONE USING 2.5 SHOULD IMMEDIATELY SWITCH TO 2.5.1.

Leo version 2.5                             July 7, 2002

See LeoDocs.leo for full details.  The highlights:

- Leo supports tab widths properly, and negative tab widths cause
  Leo to convert tabs to blanks as you type.
- Three new commands appear in the Edit Body menu:
  Convert Tabs, Convert All Tabs and Convert All Blanks.
  Convert All Tabs and Convert All Spaces convert the entire selected tree.
- Leo now allows you to override selected preferences using a
  configuration file called leoConfig.txt.
  Leo acts as before if this file does not exist.
- The Preferences panel is now contains Ok, Cancel and Revert buttons.
- Cut and paste work properly in all situations.
  You can cut and paste between Leo and other applications,
  or between two different copies of Leo.
- Added the Recent Files submenu to the File menu.
- Fixed several crashers.
- Fixed several bugs in the Import commands.
- Leo will no longer abort reading if it detects an invalid directory name
  in the Default Tangle Directory in the Preferences panel.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040519091259.27">Leo version 2.4                             June 20, 2002

This version fixes some annoying bugs and adds some nice features:

- Leo now properly highlights the headline of a newly created node.
- The Edit Headline command now works properly.
  Double and triple clicking in a headline now works as expected.
- You can now reorganize drag headlines around.
  You must drag from a node's icon and release on another node's icon.
- You can now open .leo files in  Leo by double clicking on .leo files,
  provided that you associate  Leo with .leo files.
- Improved error recovery when there are errors writing .leo files.
- All parts of LeoDocs.leo now match the documentation on Leo's web site.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040519091259.28">Leo version 2.3                             June 12, 2002

This version fixes a minor problem with Leo.

- The code that reads and writes @file nodes now uses the directory containing the
 .leo file as a default when the Default Tangle Directory setting is empty in the Preferences panel.
- The Tangle and Untangle commands have used this convention for a long time.
- This default allows us to distribute LeoPy.leo without specifying
  a directory in the Preferences Panel.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040519091259.29">Leo version 2.2                             June 2, 2002

The version fixes two bugs that happen rarely and can cause loss of data when they do happen.

- In certain circumstances  Leo v2.1 would delete most of an outline when
  a node was moved in front of the previous root node!
- All previous versions of Leo will crash when saving body text containing unicode characters.
  This could occur as the result of cutting and pasting text from another application into the body pane.
- Leo now writes body text containing unicode characters using Python's u-prefixed notation.
  That is, the body text is written as: u'escaped_text', where escaped text replaces unicode characters
  not in the ascii character set by escape sequences of the form \uxxxx.
- The result contains nothing but ascii characters, so Leo will have no problem reading it.
  Naturally, compilers and other tools may not understand Python's notation,
  so you may have to convert escaped text to something that your tools can understand.

I'm a newbie to Leo(a couple of weeks) and I feel addicted to
programming again...in fact it has resurrected a dead project of mine :)
The outline has proven most liberating in terms of testing ideas out.
Thanks a lot! -- anon

"Wow, wow, and wow. I just started using Leo about a month ago..Now I
finally understand how to use clones and I realized that this is
exactly how I want to organize my information.  Multiple views on my
data, fully interlinkable just like my thoughts...Thanks for a great
tool! -- anon

"I *LIKE* it; I was amazed at how [different the Leo] experience was
compared to flat-filing. It was almost Forth-like in the way that it
was possible to work top-down or bottom-up at will (I believe this is
the key to its strength, btw)." --Tarvin Rhodes

<t tx="EKR.20040519091259.33">Leo 4.1 beta 5 is now available at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/

For the first time in months there are no serious bugs outstanding.

Warning: By default Leo 4.1 creates .leo files that can not be read by older versions of Leo.

Warning: Use the __wx_gui.py plugin with extreme caution until further notice:
bugs in this plugin could cause body text to be lost when changing nodes.

Beta 5:
  * Leo runs in batch mode when invoked with --script aScriptFile.py
    - Created "null gui" classes that do not write to the screen.
  * Leo supports Unicode characters (e.g. Chinese) in path and file names.
  * Fixed several long-standing bugs:
    - Fixed several minor problems with the Extract Section and Import commands.
    - Fixed problem that prevent the Find panel from working on the Mac.
    - Improved @url handling so that @url file:\\path\x.leo works properly.
    - Improved support for @lineending platform.
    - Leo honors outline/body pane ratio when opening .leo files.
    - Leo now ensures that newly-opened windows fit entirely on the screen.
    - Fixed a crasher when Undoing a Change All command when searching headlines.
  - Fixed other bugs resulting from the 4.1 reorg:
    - Fixed problem loading plugins on Linux.
    - Fixed crashers in the Extract Section and Extract commands.
    - Fixed crasher when writing a file containing an undefined section.
    - Removed duplicate bindings in popup menus.
    - Made sure to show Leo's windows in wx gui plugin.

Beta 4:
  * Allow @directives and section references when executing scripts!

  - More than one section reference may now appear on the same line.
  - Use "utf-8" encoding for filenames under MacOS (Darwin)
  - Allow command or cmnd prefix for menu shortcuts under Darwin.

Beta 3:
  - Completed the reorg, making many changes to the code base.
  - Fixed a LaTeX coloring bug

Beta 2:
  - Fixed a startup problem on Linux: the "mbcs" text encoding is not valid on Linux.

Beta 1:

"I like Leo more the more I use it...It's an unexpected pleasure to
see my (linearly written) code outlined in Leo. I can't wait to use
Leo to start a new project, going from outline to code...Thanks again
for providing the computing community with such a fine piece of
software." -- Jim Shapiro, Ph.D.

"If you think you have used all possible programmer's editors, but
have not yet tried Leo, you are wrong...I rate Leo as a 'must have'
for Python programmers. The code makes for a good read."

<t tx="EKR.20040519091259.35">Leo 4.0.4 is now available at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/

The 4.0.x releases fix numerous minor bugs.

Please note: it will be severals weeks before Leo supports unicode
characters in file or directory names. Until then, please use ascii
names.

Changes made in 4.0.4:
-----------------------
- Fixed a problem with the titles in Font and Color panels.
- Worked around a Unicode assert failure in the colorizer.
- Fixed crasher in OnEndEditHeadline.
- Fixed import problems in leoPlugins.leo.
- @first and @last sentinels no longer contain corresponding text.
  This fixes a problem that affected PHP comment delimiters.

Changes made in 4.0.3:
-----------------------
- Fixed several problems with the auto_save and plugin menu plugins.
- Fixed a problem with the Go To Line Number command.

Changes made in 4.0.2:
-----------------------
- Fixed a crasher in reportBadChars when a .leo file contains a character that
  can not be represented in the encoding specified in the first line of the
  .leo file.
- Leo now sends full tracebacks to the log window when Leo takes an unexpected
 exception.
- Leo now issues a more informative message when the @comment directive
  inhibits the Untangle command.

Changes made in 4.0.1:
------------------------
- Fixed several crashers, one of which may prevent Leo from starting.
- Fixed indentation for section references that are preceded by something
  other than whitespace.
- Removed debugging traces when reading and writing unknown attributes.
- Removed some improperly cloned nodes from LeoDocs.leo.
- Added the checkTopologyOfAllClones script.
- Fixed some problems with plugins.

Highlights of 4.0 final:
-----------------------
** Improved and simplified format of derived files.
  - Eliminated child indices, extraneous blank lines and @body sentinels.
  - Eliminated @node sentinels that indicate outline structure.
  - New @nl and @nonl sentinels indicate where newlines are and aren't.

** Greatly improved error handling.
  - Reading derived files _never_ alter outline structure or links.
  - Read errors leave the outline completely unchanged.
  - Broken clone links are gone forever.
  - As a result, 4.0 is much safer than all previous versions.

** Full compatibility will previous versions of Leo.
  - Leo 4.0 reads all derived files properly, regardless of version.
  - Leo writes new-format derived files by default, and this default may be changed.
  - New commands in the read/write menu allow you to explicitly specify the format of derived files.

I've written documentation in WordPerfert, Ventura, Word, PageMaker, and
FrameMaker and even though they create wonderfully looking and useful
documents, they've never been able to do what I've been looking for. HTML,
compiled help files, and later PDF came closer, but still not there. I think
I've found it in Leo, a way to make a "living" document. A document built out
of discrete parts that can be re-organized on the fly to meet the needs of a
varying audience...Being a convert for less than a day I've still got a lot to
learn, but just the possibility of keeping system maintenance scripts in the IT
manual is mind boggling.  -- David Nichols

This is one of the most interesting versions of Leo ever released:

The highlights of 3.9:
----------------------
* Major performance improvements:
  - Incremental syntax coloring speeds response when typing.
  - Incremental undo drastically reduces memory used.

* Major improvements in customizing Leo:
  - Leo looks in the file customizeLeo.py for user-specific customizations.
  - Leo calls "hook routines" in customizeLeo.py for all commands and events.
    These hook routines can modify or replace any command or event.
  - New convenience routines simplify creating and modifying menus.
  - Easy translation of menus to other languages using customizeLeo.py.

* Better integration with other tools:
  - The Open With command allows you to communicate back and forth with other editors.
  - The Go To Line Number command converts lines numbers in derived files
    to locations in the outline.
  - Double-clicking the icon of a @url node launches any url in your web browser.

    This is much more convenient than opening Leo's Idle window.
  - Much better support for cweb. At last, Leo has a power user of cweb.
    By default, @space, @* and @** sections are colored as latex text.
    Leo properly generates @q..@&gt; sentinels.
  - @nosentinelfile is like @file except Leo writes no sentinel lines.

* Other improvements:
  - Optional Emacs-style auto-indent.
  - Reformat Paragraph command.
  - Leo will optionally create nonexistent directories specified in
    @file, @root or @path, including all nonexistent parent directories.
  - Leo will place its own icon in Leo windows provided that you have
    installed Fredrik Lundh's PIL and tkIcon packages.
  - The usual assortment of bug fixes.

Quote of the month

I only have one week of Leo experience but I already know it will be my default
IDE/project manager.  I have seen several old threads on c.l.python  where people
complain about the lack of a project manager for the free/standard Python IDE's
like Idle.  Leo clearly solves that problem and in a way that commercial tools
can't touch -- Marshall Parsons

Quote of the month
------------------
I only have one week of Leo experience but I already know it will be my default
IDE/project manager.  I have seen several old threads on c.l.python  where people
complain about the lack of a project manager for the free/standard Python IDE's
like Idle.  Leo clearly solves that problem and in a way that commercial tools
can't touch -- Marshall Parsons

Quote of the Month:
-------------------
I gave Leo a try a while ago, but did not recognize its strengths as an
outliner. In April 2003 a gave it another try. And when I saw in the online
help mentioning clones almost in passing (you got to emphasis this much
more!), I knew: This is it.

If you are like me, you have a kind of knowledge base with infos gathered over
time. And you have projects, where you use some of those infos. Now, with
conventional outliners you begin to double these infos, because you want to
have the infos needed for the project with your project. With Leo you can do
this too, but if you change text in one place IT IS UPDATED IN THE OTHER PLACE
TOO! This is a feature I did not see with any other outliner (and I tried a
few). Amazing! Leo directly supports the way I work! -- F. Geiger

leo.py 3.12 is now available at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/

This version fixes many bugs and adds several major new features.  There are no known serious bugs in this version of Leo. 

Window sizes are now in pixels rather than grid units, so you must resize existing outlines (.leo files) when opening them for the first time using this version of Leo.  Don't panic!

Highlights of this version:

* Plugged a huge memory leak.
* Fixed a major bug involving undo.
* Added Icon &amp; Status areas to Leo window for use by plugins.
* Important new plugins:
  - The file leoPlugins.leo now contains all plugins.
  - add_directives.py allows plugins to define new directives.
  - color_markup.py supports wiki-styled markup.
  - mod_spelling.py checks spelling (requires aspell to be installed).
  - nav_buttons.py creates browser-style navigation plugins in the icon area.
  - plugins_menu.py creates a Plugins menu items for all loaded plugins.
  - scripts_menu.py creates a Scripts menu for all scripts in scripts folder.
  - spell
  - trace_gc traces all changes to memory at idle time.
* Other enhancements:
  - Redesigned the Find panel.   Non-functional options are dimmed.
  - Added @wrap and @nowrap directives.
  - Added Write Dirty @file Nodes command.
  - Added several new "stub hooks".
  - Hyperlinks are now enabled by default.
  - Leo now loads plugins in alphabetical order.
  - Leo now remembers the size and location of Leo windows.
  - Undo now restores the insert point or the selection range after most commands.
  - Added apply button to Font panel.

leo.py 3.12 is now available at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/

This version fixes many bugs and adds several major new features.

The first announcement of 3.12 appeared a few days ago on SourceForge.  Since then, a few minor bugs have been found.  In particular, if would be best, when installing Leo on Linux, to remove previous installations of Leo before running the install script.  This will ensure that the new subdirectories of the main Leo directory are created properly.

Window sizes are now in pixels rather than grid units, so you must resize existing outlines (.leo files) when opening them for the first time using this version of Leo.  Don't panic!

<t tx="ekr.20040630103409">Leo 4.2 Beta 1 is now available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/

Beta 1 completes all fundamental work in the 4.2 code base. All essential code
is complete. Dozens of bugs have been fixed since the Alpha 3 release about a
month ago.

The highlights of Leo 4.2:

- @thin trees make Leo much more friendly to cvs. Files derived from @thin can
be committed to cvs and updated from cvs without having to commit or update the
corresponding .leo file. There is no longer any need to keep .leo files and
derived files in synch.

- Leo's data structures have been reorganized. As a result, all outline
operations are much faster. To support this organization, scripts that traverse
Leo's data structures must now use a positions rather than vnodes. Old scripts
that appear to use vnodes will still work because methods like c.currentVnode
that appear to return vnodes actually return positions.

Quotes of the month
-------------------

"I'm a newbie to Leo(a couple of weeks) and I feel addicted to
programming again...in fact it has resurrected a dead project of mine :)
The outline has proven most liberating in terms of testing ideas out.
Thanks a lot!" -- anon

"Wow, wow, and wow. I just started using Leo about a month ago..Now I
finally understand how to use clones and I realized that this is
exactly how I want to organize my information.  Multiple views on my
data, fully interlinkable just like my thoughts...Thanks for a great
tool! -- anon

"I *LIKE* it; I was amazed at how [different the Leo] experience was
compared to flat-filing. It was almost Forth-like in the way that it
was possible to work top-down or bottom-up at will (I believe this is
the key to its strength, btw)." --Tarvin Rhodes

What is Leo?
------------

- A literate programming tool, compatible with noweb and CWEB.
- A data organizer and project manager. Leo provides multiple views
   of projects within a single outline.
- Fully scriptable using Python. Leo saves its files in XML format.
- Portable. leo.py is 100% pure Python.
- Open Software, distributed under the Python License.

Leo requires Python 2.2.1 or above and tcl/tk 8.4 or above.
Leo works on Linux, Windows and MacOs X.

<t tx="ekr.20040630210818">HTML Editing in Leo is soooo much easier then with NoNodeEditors. Ive
had a blast working on a web page. Usually I had to look at a bunch of
gunk all at once. Now I can look at little pieces of gunk! :) 

-Anon (for now)

Before leo, I try to avoid or refactor long functions. With leo, I am
very tempted not to. Being able to view and slice my code at a higher
level in pretty much anyway I want, I feel like a commanding master in
my own mess...Leo lets me be lazy and get away with it. ;)

Mark Ng

[Quote] I have just finished a little embedded system for someone, written in
C using leo as the editor. I told the customer he _had_ to use leo for
ongoing maintenance, after I looked at one of the main state machines:
600 lines in the derived file, but trivialy easy to get your head
around in Leo...

The good news is that having been forced to meet leo he thinks it'll
solve many other problems that his company has with code maintenance.
Another step to world domination!

Leo allows you to do things that you'd never consider with another editor. 

BTW: in a real-time embedded system like I was working on, not having
the overhead of a function call (which you'd have had if you'd split
the case statement as you would with a normal editor) saves time, and
makes the system more flexible...

<t tx="ekr.20040810104041">Leo 4.2 Beta 3 is now available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/

This version of Leo is feature complete. Leo's core code has been
stable for several months.

To do: most plugins work with the new code base, but other plugins
need some more work. Late note: the *nix install script will work
better with *nix line endings :-)

The highlights of Leo 4.2:

- @thin trees make Leo much more friendly to cvs.

- Leo's data structures have been reorganized to make outline
operations significantly faster. All old script still work.

- @test and @script nodes convert scripts to unit tests automatically.
  Converting scripts to unit tests now takes a few seconds!

- A faster and more robust spell checker plugin. (requires Python 2.3)

- Leo is now much more friendly to using spaces instead of tabs.

- The Execute Script command reports erroneous lines more clearly.

- The Perfect Import feature guarantee that Leo imports file exactly.

- Leo draws large outlines more quickly with less memory used.

- Dozens of other improvements.

Quote of the month
------------------

Leo is the best IDE that I have had the pleasure to use. I have been using it
now for about 2 -- 3 months. It has totally changed not only the way that I
program, but also the way that I store and organize all of the information that
I need for the job that I do. -- Ian Mulvany

What is Leo?
------------
- A programmer's editor, an outlining editor and a flexible browser.
- A literate programming tool, compatible with noweb and CWEB.
- A data organizer and project manager. Leo provides multiple views
   of projects within a single outline.
- Fully scriptable using Python. Leo saves its files in XML format.
- Portable. leo.py is 100% pure Python.
- Open Software, distributed under the Python License.

Leo requires Python 2.2.1 or above and tcl/tk 8.4 or above.
Leo works on Linux, Windows and MacOs X.

This is the script that I use to create 'official' distributions of Leo. It
should run on any Leo installation.

According to the distutils docs, the way to create a source distribution is by
running:
    
    'python createLeoDist.py sdist &lt;args&gt;'

where the file createLeoDist.py contains the following:
    
    modules = []
    distutils.core.setup (
        &lt;&lt; setup info for createLeoDist.py &gt;&gt;
    )
    
N.B. createLeoDist.py _must_ be run from the leo folder! This file is
distributed in the dist folder, so this script makes a temporary copy of
createLeoDist.py to the leo folder.
    
The section called &lt; &lt; setup info for createLeoDist.py &gt; &gt; contains further
information. Make sure to update this information before running this script.</t>

New in 4.3 a1.

- This script should run on all Leo installations; the script computes the locations
  of all files as 'offsets' from g.app.loadDir.
  
- This script temporarily copies .pycheckrc from the the leo/.. folder to the leo folder.

This allows us to distribute .pycheckrc somewhere, even if it isn't in correct place.
  
- This script temporarily copies createLeoDist.py from the dist folder to the leo folder.

Leo 4.3 is the culmination of more than four months of work. In spite
of its alpha status, I recommend Leo 4.3a1 over any 4.2 release.

The defining features of Leo 4.3:
---------------------------------
1. Leo now stores options in @settings trees, that is, outlines whose
headline is '@settings'. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for
@settings trees not only in the outline being opened but also in
various leoSettings.leo files.

Users can create arbitrarily complex user options with @settings
trees. Leo settings outlines are, in fact, infinitely more flexible
and powerful than any scheme based on flat text. Readers of Python's
configParser shootout take note.

2. The Preferences command temporarily replaces the outline pane with
an outline showing all the @settings trees in effect. The Preferences
command also replaces the body pane with a "settings pane". This
settings pane allows you to change the settings selected in the
outline pane using standard gui widgets.

3. Leo's read/write code in leoAtFile.py has been rewritten to support
user-defined tangling and untangling. This is a major cleanup of
Leo's core.

4. Leo now boasts a wonderful new Plugins Manager plugin. This plugin
enables and disables plugins automatically and tells you everything
you need to know about each plugin. This plugin also lets you download
plugins from Leo's cvs site.

5. You can install third-party extensions in Leo's extensions
directory. Leo will attempt to import such extensions from the
extensions directory if normal imports fail.

As usual, version 4.3 contains many other improvements and bug fixes.

What people are saying about Leo
--------------------------------
"I am using Leo since a few weeks and I brim over with enthusiasm for
it. I think it is the most amazing software since the invention of the
spreadsheet." -- juergen_r

"We who use Leo know that it is a breakthrough tool and a whole new
way of writing code."  -- Joe Orr

"I am a huge fan of Leo. I think it's quite possibly the most
revolutionary programming tool I have ever used and it (along with the
Python language) has utterly changed my view of programming (indeed of
writing) forever."  -- Shakeeb Alireza

"Thank you very much for Leo. I think my way of working with data will
change forever...I am certain [Leo] will be a revolution. The
revolution is as important as the change from sequential linear
organization of a book into a web-like hyperlinked pages. The main
concept that impress me is that the source listing isn't the main
focus any more. You focus on the non-linear, hierarchical, collapsible
outline of the source code."  -- Korakot Chaovavanich 

"Leo is a quantum leap for me in terms of how many projects I can
manage and how much information I can find and organize and store in a
useful way."  -- Dan Winkler

"Wow, wow, and wow...I finally understand how to use clones and I
realized that this is exactly how I want to organize my information.
Multiple views on my data, fully interlinkable just like my thoughts."
-- Anon.

"A few years back I would have said Zope was #1 Python showcase, but I
agree 100% that Leo is tops now." -- Jason Cunliffe

"Leo is the most interesting Python project I know of...I see lots of
stuff posted on the Daily Python page, but I usually yawn and come
over to this forum to see what's cooking."  -- Anon

What people are saying about Leo
--------------------------------
"[Leo] should either replace or greatly augment the development tools
that I use." -- Zak Greant

"Leo is a marriage of outlining and literate programming. Pure genius.
The main reason I am impressed with this tool is that it doesn't
affect your choice of tools. You can use whatever IDE for whatever
language and switch back and forth between Leo and it." -- Austin
King

"Leo is the best IDE that I have had the pleasure to use. I have been
using it now for about 2--3 months. It has totally changed not only
the way that I program, but also the way that I store and organize all
of the information that I need for the job that I do." -- Ian Mulvany

"I only have one week of Leo experience but I already know it will be
my default IDE/project manager...people complain about the lack of a
project manager for the free/standard Python IDE's like Idle. Leo
clearly solves that problem and in a way that commercial tools can't
touch." -- Marshall Parsons

"I have been using Leo for about 3 weeks and I hardly use my other
programming editor anymore...I find it easy and enjoyable to use. I
plan to adopt it as my presentation tool for code reviews." -- Jim
Vickroy

"I'm absolutely astounded by the power of such a simple idea! It works
great and I can immediately see the benefits of using Leo in place of
the standard flat file editor." -- Tom Lee, &lt;tomlee@bigpond.net.au&gt;

I think you're really showing what open source can do and your current
trajectory puts you on track to kick Emacs into the dustbin of
computing history. -- Dan Winkler

Leo 4.3 is the culmination of more than five months of work. In spite
of its alpha status, I recommend Leo 4.3a1 over any 4.2 release.

This alpha 2 release corrects various bugs and distribution problems.
It also adds these new features:

- Adds 'word', 'line' and 'node' undo granularities.
- Predefines 'c','g', and 'p' in scripts and unit tests.
- Added support for top-level init functions in plugins.
- Buttons can remove themselves when their scripts fail.

What people are saying about Leo
--------------------------------
"When first I opened Leo, it was out of curiosity. But having used
it...I'll never go back. They'll have to pry Leo out of my cold, dead
fingers! Seriously, it should be renamed 'Crack Cocaine' because it's
that addictive. I'm ready to start a 12-Step group."
-- Travers A. Hough

"I feel addicted to programming again...in fact [Leo] has resurrected
a dead project of mine :) The Outline has proven most liberating in
terms of testing ideas out." -- Anon

"I have been absolutely seduced by Leo over the past few days. I tell
you, I can not put it down. I feel like a kid with a shiny new
bike...I'm already bursting with new ways I'd like to use the tool in
the future." -- Lyn Adams Headley

Thanks for the great work--I love Leo!!! -- Josef Dalcolmo

Leo has simplified updating and creating new scripts and .bats keeping
similar information in the same place. there is almost an addictive
withdrawal effect when I can complete an operation in so much less
time with Leo &amp; python than I had become used to. -- Anon

What people are saying about Leo
--------------------------------
"Word outlines are very useful. But Leo makes Word look like a clunky toy." --Joe Orr

"Leo is an interactive editor for organizing text fragments hierarchically and sequentially into one or more files and hierarchical folders, without arbitrary limits on the number and size of text fragments and the depth of the hierarchy...Tangle is a tool for combining hierarchically and sequentially organized text fragments into text files, hierarchically grouped into folders, with hierarchical or sequential organization of text within the files, and without arbitrary limits on the size and number of files and the depth of the hierarchy of folders and text nesting within the files." -- Alex Abacus

"Leo reminds me a great deal of things I loved when I used Userland's Frontier (an outlining cms with a native oodb) - but Frontier wasn't hackable enough for me, and it wasn't oriented towards coding and literate programming, and you couldn't round-trip rendered pages (big Leo win). This is really a super tool - in a matter of days I've started to use it on all my projects and I still haven't figured out how I lived without it." -- John Sequeira

"Leo is EXACTLY the kind of outliner I was looking for--fantastic job!" -- Steve Allen

"If you are like me, you have a kind of knowledge base with infos gathered over time. And you have projects, where you use some of those infos. Now, with conventional outliners you begin to double these infos, because you want to have the infos needed for the project with your project. With Leo you can do this too, but if you change text in one place IT IS UPDATED IN THE OTHER PLACE TOO! This is a feature I did not see with any other outliner (and I tried a few). Amazing! Leo directly supports the way I work!" -- F. Geiger

What people are saying about Leo
--------------------------------
"Another day, another breakthrough using Leo--now I realize Leo is the best URL bookmark manager there is. No more bookmarks menus or favorites lists inside the browser for me. With the @url directive I can just double click on the URL to open it in my browser. Leo lets me arrange the URLs in a hierarchy (or multiple hierarchies), attach notes to them, save clippings of things I read on the sites. It's sooo much better than anything the browsers have built in and it lets me easily use different browsers on different platforms and different machines (try that with the browsers' built-in bookmark managers)." -- Dan Winkler

"I am an amateur photographer. I use plain old 35mm. film for my pictures. Over the weekend, I used Leo to organize my lists of pictures. It is quite helpful--I can have separate nodes for pictures I have enlarged, as well as pictures I have submitted to our local camera club. Thanks!" -- Rich Reis

"Cloning is pure genius!... Leo's cloning facility, allows me to create several views on the CFA course material. My main view follows the prescribed study guide. Another view is organized like the textbooks. Yet another gives me a glossary of terms. And when I'm done, I'll have some nice libraries...I can re-use later in other projects." -- Michael Manti
