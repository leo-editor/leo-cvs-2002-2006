# Leo loads plugins in the order they appear in this file.
# 
# The FIRST mention of a plugin in this file controls whether the plugin is 
# enabled or not:
# - If the plugin's name is commented out, it is disabled, otherwise it is 
# enabled.
# - Plugins not appearing in this file are disabled.
# 
# File names may be indented as desired.
