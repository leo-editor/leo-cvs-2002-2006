# If your plugin uses lots of module-level globals, you may define them in 
# this
# section. You may also define a few globals in the root node.
# 
# However, having lots of globals is an indication that it might be best to
# recast your code using a class. The ivars of this class would replace the
# globals.
# 
# N.B. If your plugin uses data in an outline, it is almost always a bad idea 
# to
# access the data using g.top(). Instead, your plugin should define an 
# onCreate
# function as shown in other nodes. onCreate will create a class instance in
# which self.c is bound to a single commander.
