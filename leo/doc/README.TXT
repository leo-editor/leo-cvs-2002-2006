To learn about Leo, see: http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of 4.3.2:
-----------------------

- Improved Leo's documentation:
    - A tutorial introduction to Leo:
      http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html
    - A 5-minute guide to programming with Leo:
      http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html#quick-start-for-programmers

- The new rst3 plugin creates .html and .tex files from reStructuredText
  embedded in Leo files. Any node of the source outline may contain options for
  the rst3 plugin, which makes this plugin much more useful and flexible than
  the previous rst plugins. All of Leo's documentation was created using this
  plugin from sources in LeoDocs.leo. For full documentation for rst3 see:
  http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/rstplugin3.html

- Small but important improvements to the spellpyx (spell checking) plugin make
  this plugin much easier to use.
 
- Improved the Pretty Printing command.

- The usual assortment of bug fixes.
