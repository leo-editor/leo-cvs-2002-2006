Leo 4.4 beta 1                                             January 17, 2006

The code is stable; there are no known serious bugs. Some features are
incomplete.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
--------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Dozens of other new features and bug fixes since Leo 4.3.3.
