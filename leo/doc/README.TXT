Leo 4.4 alpha 6                                               February 17, 2006

Leo 4.4 b2 was broken on some platforms. Leo 4.4 a6 should fix those problems
forever. However, only wider distribution will verify that for certain. Besides
fixing the fatal problems with Leo 4.4b2, this version fixes two minor bugs and
adds some new settings in leoSettings.leo.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

What's new in Leo 4.4 a6:
------------------------
- Smoother user interface.
- New commands that support mouseless Leo.
- Minibuffer search commands provide all features of Leo's legacy search commands.
- User modes are fully functional; you can create bindings just for the minibuffer.
- New master key and click handlers and improved allocation of screen widgets.

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
--------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
  name, with tab completion.
- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
  and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
  regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.
- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
  Vim, or any other editor.
- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
  dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
  create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions. - Dozens
  of other new features and bug fixes since Leo 4.3.3.

Coming soon in Leo 4.4:
-----------------------
- A revived chapters plugin.
- Autocompleter Tab.
- Improved incremental searches.
