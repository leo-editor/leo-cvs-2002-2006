System requirements for leo.py
------------------------------

leo.py requires Python 2.1 and tcl/tk 8.3 or above.

	Download Python from http://python.org/ 
	Download tcl/Tk from http://tcl.activestate.com/software/tcltk/

Warning: When building Tcl on Linux, do not specify "--enable-threads" .
Only use Tcl with the default "threads not enabled" case.

Installing the leo.py on Linux
------------------------------

You can install Leo using the install script provided.  Remember to 'chmod +x' before running this script.

Leo is distributed as a single compressed (.zip) folder.  Simply uncompress this folder, put the folder in a convenient place and run leo.py.  You can run leo.py by double-clicking leo.py.  You can also run leo.py from a Python interpreter as follows:

	import leo
	leo.run() # runs leo.py, opening a new outline.
	leo.go() # runs leo.py after reloading all modules.
	leo.leoOpen(fileName) # runs leo.py, reloads all modules, and opens fileName.

You may specify options using the configuration file called leoConfig.txt.  You should generate this file using leoConfig.leo.
Installing the leo.py on Windows
--------------------------------

Important: You can install leo.py on Windows using the single-click installer called leosetup.exe.

Leo is distributed as a single compressed (.zip) folder.  Uncompress this folder, put the folder in a convenient place and run leo.py.  You can run leo.py by double-clicking leo.py.  You can also run leo.py from a Python interpreter as follows:

	import leo
	leo.run() # runs leo.py, opening a new outline.

	leo.leoOpen(fileName) # runs leo.py, reloads all modules, and opens fileName.

Installing leo.py on MacOs
--------------------------

Bruce M. Bolden, bruceb@cs.uidaho.edu, is using Leo on MaxOS X.  Here is his description of how to get Leo working there:

I installed: 
- Latest OS X Developer tools
- latest (as of about two weeks ago) tk/tcl
		 MacOSXTk8.4a4-2.tar.gz
- the machopython distribution
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/MachoPython-2.2.1.dmg

For OS X 10.1, I followed the directions at:
	http://tony.lownds.com/macosx/tkinter.html

That worked fine for 10.1, but didn't work for 10.2.  It
took awhile to find a Python distribution that worked
correctly with tk/tcl.

I was just getting into Leo about a week before 10.2 was released and thought about---what if it breaks....10.2 broke it, but I was able to find a solution as described above.

More re MacOS from Bruce Bolden
-------------------------------

I just finished building tk successfully!  The magic step was the execution of the command

cp ../generic/prolog.ps to ../library/prolog.ps

AFTER 

cd ../../tk/macosx

in the instructions on "Steps to build Tcl/Tk 8.4.0 on MacOS X":

http://mini.net/tcl/4052

I found this solution while looking at the tcl-mac mailing list archive.  The earlier (current?) tar ball on SourceForge did not have the file prolog.ps in the library directory:

http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=1060496&forum_id=3853

Copy and Paste seem to work just fine now in Leo!  This was my original question for you.

I also noticed that someone else built everything on OS X 10.2 (Jaguar), but they did it under X.  Since, the new version of Tk appears to support the OS X interface quite well, I'm not going to bother installing X (for now).

So, Leo works two different ways on OS X 10.2.

Using shell scripts and batch files to make using Leo easier
------------------------------------------------------------

On Linux, the following shell script will allow you to open foo.leo files by typing leo foo

#!/bin/sh 
python <leopath>/leo.py $1

where <leopath> is replaced with the path to the leo directory. 

On Windows, the equivalent batch file would be:

c:\python22\python <leopath>leo.py %1
