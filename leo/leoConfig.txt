# leoConfig.txt: configuration file for Leo.
# 7/8/2002 by Edward K. Ream

# Leo looks for this file using the directory in sys.leo_config_directory.
# (You would typically set this attribute in sitecustomize.py).
# If sys.leo_config_directory does not exist,
# Leo attempts to load this file from the directory from which Leo was loaded.

# Settings in this file override settings in all .leo files.
# Leo does not write settings to the <preferences> and <find_panel_settings>
# elements of .leo files that exist in this file.

# Leo uses Python's ConfigParser module, so this file has all the features
# (and bugs!) of the ConfigParser module.

# Comments start with a pound character.
# You may specify booleans as 0/1, no/yes, false/true, off/on (case insensitive).
# These get converted to 0/1 if the file is not read_only

# WARNING: Do not place any options before the [config options] section.

# WARNING: Clearing the read_only attribute will cause Leo to remove
# all comments and alter order of attributes when rewriting this file!!
